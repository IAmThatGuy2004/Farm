# Farm Simulator

A Java-based farming simulation game that demonstrates object-oriented programming principles through an interactive agricultural experience.

## Overview

**Farm Simulator** allows players to manage their own virtual farm, making decisions about livestock while experiencing the challenges and rewards of farm management. The application showcases advanced OOP concepts including **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism** to create a modular and expandable codebase.

### Object-Oriented Programming Principles:
- **Encapsulation**: Data and methods are bundled within classes, ensuring controlled access.
- **Inheritance**: Shared behaviors and attributes are inherited from parent classes.
- **Polymorphism**: Objects of different classes can be treated as objects of a common superclass.
